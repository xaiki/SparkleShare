sparkleshare (0.2.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * [f320fef] Imported Upstream version 0.2.5
    + Reimplement notes to be less buggy and backend independent. Polish
      about dialog and event log html. Fix a bug where large collections of
      files weren't being synced when adding them at the same time. The
      event log now collapses huge change sets and squashes events together
      by day when they are on the same day and in the same folder.
  * [8f862d6] Require mono 2.10 and cli-common-dev 0.8.
    New upstream release uses some CLR 4.0 APIs and so we need to bump the
    BDs
