sparkleshare (0.2.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * [f320fef] Imported Upstream version 0.2.5
    + Reimplement notes to be less buggy and backend independent. Polish
      about dialog and event log html. Fix a bug where large collections of

      by day when they are on the same day and in the same folder.
  * [8f862d6] Require mono 2.10 and cli-common-dev 0.8.
    New upstream release uses some CLR 4.0 APIs and so we need to bump the
